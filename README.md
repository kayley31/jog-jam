# Welcome to the Jog Jam App

For our final project, we have created an app called ‘Jog Jam’ which generates music playlists for runners. We chose this project as it allowed us to put into practice the skills we have learned throughout the degree, while pushing us beyond our initial skill set. The project aims to create a fully functioning React application that is cohesive and scalable, while satisfying a potential gap in the market for people who listen to music while they run.

## How to run the app

Before you continue, please make sure you are in the `main` branch

### Running Node Server
Get the node server up and running by:
1) Going into ./spotify-app/node-server
2) Running the following in the terminal:
    `node server.js`

If this step is successful, you should see "Server is running on port 3001" in the terminal.

### Running React Application
Get the react application up and running by:
1) Going into ./spotify-app/running-app
2) Making sure you have react bootstrap dependencies, you should run the following command in the terminal:
    `npm install react-router-dom react-bootstrap bootstrap`
3) Making sure you have installed the redux packages by running the following in the terminal:
    `npm install`

If this is successful you should see "You can now view running-app in the browser".

You should now be able to see the application running locally:
